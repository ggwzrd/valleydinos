      Since I was a child I always had the passion for technology.
In fact, when I had to choose my specialization, I chose the Computer Science field. From that moment my horizons have been opened to a new type of interest: programming.
Those studies taught me different styles of programming and ways of thinking; one of those is the pattern MVC ( Model View Controller ) that is used to implement user interface and make it more usable. This perspective became my policy, “to make a complicated action simpler for the costumer”.
One I finished the hight school I started to work for a Web Designer. The task I was assigned to was to develop the front and back end of a website while he provided me a template to work with.
Thanks to this experience, I started to be more involved and interested in the style and the design of a website with an attitude aimed at creating a simpler code, fashionable and interactive for the costumer as well. Because of the economic crises we have in Italy, the manager couldn’t pay me a salary. The lack of opportunity and chance for the future I decide to move to Holland. Here I started to work in Material in Motion and then as a Customer Support Representative in TomTom.
As a matter of fact I discovered the meaning and the importance of working in a multicultural team and I really enjoy the feeling to be part of a group where you can share ideas and opinions on project where all are equally involved, regardless of their employment status.
Now, I wold like to prove myself with new scenarios and I’m looking for a front-end position in a team of programmers where I can test my skills and creativity, concentrating on developing, a clearer and more usable user interface.
